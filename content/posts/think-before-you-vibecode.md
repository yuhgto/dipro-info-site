I don’t know who needs to hear this, but hold off vibe-coding your next production app...

Vibe coding apps like Lovable & Base44 will make it easy for power users to build custom software without code. 

But try going to market with your application. 

## GTM challenges
What do you do when a customer:
1️⃣ Asks you which TLS cipher suites you support? (Or worse, asks you to stop supporting outdated ones)
2️⃣ Needs their data stored in Australia?
3️⃣ Sees a Lovable URL in the dev tools?

This applies whether you're listing on a SaaS marketplace or releasing to the wild. 

## Top concerns from customers
I talk to marketplace app developers every day. 
This is what their customers are concerned by:

🛠️ Security: 
More users are sensitive to the security of their app data (especially the enterprise).
Can you answer basic questions about how your app handles and exposes customer data? 

🌏 Data residency and privacy:
It’s not just about protecting user data from threats; you need to give them control too.
Do you know where your app is hosted? Where it stores data? 
And can you control it?

🎁 New features:
You have your first investor. Yay! They want to see you make big bets in your product. But you have thousands of lines of code and tons of dependencies. 
Do you know where to start building your big next feature? Does Cursor?

🤝 Support:
Your first investor found a bug.
Do you know where to look first? Do you have the knowledge and context to fix it? 

I'm not stopping you from building that dream app of yours. 
But make sure you have good responses to basic questions about it. 

PS: If you still want to vibe-code an internal app, check out my colleague Amichay's experiments with Base44

PPS: Despite the emojis, I didn't use AI to write this 😜
