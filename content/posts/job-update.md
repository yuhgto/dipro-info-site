A couple of weeks ago, I said goodbye to my colleagues at monday.com. I started there out of college; it was perhaps the hardest job I've ever had; but I learned so much. 

Some highlights: 

1 - I got turned into a meme

2 - I learned what developer advocacy is - talk to the people who are using your APIs and turn their experiments/frustrations/fears into new product stuff. 
(Tons more thoughts about this topic but I'll leave that for another post)

3 - I got called out by customers left right and center. The trick is to channel that into heated arguments with dev lol. 
(For the record, we all remained friends afterwards)

4 - Organizing hackathons for partners to build new apps. These events birthed some of the most successful apps in the monday marketplace. 
(The years of troubleshooting calls after the hackathons also helped)

Some thank yous:

Too long of a list to count. But here are some special people from monday past and present: 

- Ruchita De: my day one
- Cynthia Gordon, Tom Ronen, and Vlad Mystetskyi: the best managers over the years
- Rachel Flynn, Alessandra, Matias Davidson, Mohammad Musleh, Shaul Gittelman, Alex Savchuk, Helen Lu, Danny Silva for holding on for dear life while we built cool shit
