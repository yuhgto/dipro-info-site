I built the developer experience at monday (along with an amazing team). Some cool stuff I am proud of:

### Hackathons

I've run a lot of hackathons over the years. The first time I ran a hackathon, we saw one of the most popular monday apps invented (General Caster). The next year, we gave away a Tesla to the winning team.

### Kitchen sink example app
- I built monday's "Kitchen Sink" app example, a gallery of code samples that new developers can use to get a feel for the framework
- Github Link
- Install from the monday marketplace

### Youtube series: Build a monday CRM app
- Youtube playlist
- Accompanying example app
